# TicTacToe-Console

This program creates a game of Tic-Tac-Toe without a graphical user interface and prints to the console. The players get the choose how many players there are, the number of connections you need to win, the size of the board, the tokens each player uses, and which data structure the game is implemented with.

The two implementations for the program are a speed efficient and a memory effiecent implementation.

The speed efficient implementation uses an array to store the entire game board. Boards of large sizes may produce issues related to memory managment.

The memory efficient implementation uses a hash map to store all the values of the game board, but will run a bit slower.
